        <h2>Computer Organisation</h2>
        <p>
          Computer science is all about providing abstractions and their efficient implementation. 
          An abstraction provides a logical view of a certain service or a resource by giving a 
          well-defined black-box model, its associated properties, and hides the internal details 
          of the black-box.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, the design and implementation of a processor are abstracted away through 
          the Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) of the processor. Further, high-level programming 
          languages like C, C++ abstract away the ISA of a processor by allowing programmers to 
          express their intent using constructs like for-loops, while-loops, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this lab, the first two experiments deal with two primitive data abstractions: 
          integers and floating-point numbers. We look at various approaches for representing 
          integers and floating-point numbers in binary and their pros and cons.
        </p>
        <p>
          The next four experiments involve writing assembly language programs using MIPS and ARM 
          ISA. In these experiments, we learn how to map high-level language constructs to a 
          sequence of assembly language instructions.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the last experiment, we study how to design a processor for a subset of MIPS ISA 
          using the Single Cycle Per Instruction approach. This helps us understand how high-level 
          language constructs map to assembly programs, followed by realizing assembly instructions 
          using logic gates.
        </p>
        <p>
          Processor, Memory, and I/O Devices are three major subsystems in a computer. Cache 
          memory plays a crucial role in bridging the speed mismatch between a processor and the 
          associated main memory module.
        </p>
        <p>
          We have three experiments on cache memories illustrating various possible cache 
          organizations and their impact on program performance. Additionally, one experiment 
          covers the concept of Virtual Memory.

        <h3>Recommendation</h3>
        <p>
          We recommend using our customized VirtualBox for smooth simulation execution. 
          Install VirtualBox from Virtual Labs to ensure compatibility with required dependencies.
